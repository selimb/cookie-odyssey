# Programming Language

My choices were:

- Python (and probably Django)
- Kotlin
- Elixir
- Rust

In the end I went with Rust.

## Python

Python is one of my main languages, and despite all its faults I still enjoy it.
I also have experience with Django, and it's a damn productive stack.
However, it's the most resource-heavy language of the bunch.

## Kotlin

I've heard good things about Kotlin, and it looks like a great language.
I have little Java/JVM experience though, so I feel like there's a steep learning curve.

## Elixir

BEAM is objectively the best runtime, and Phoenix gets a lot of praise.
The lack of type-safety drives me nuts though.

## Rust

I already do a little Rust at work, and really like the language: excellent type-safety (although
even I would admit sometimes it's a bit too much), best performance, and career-wise I think it's a good
language to become proficient in.

The web dev sphere still seems to be evolving, but then again all the other languages, except for
Elixir and maybe Python, also have a fair bit of churn.
