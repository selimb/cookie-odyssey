# ORM

I went with SeaORM.
It looks well-maintained, and is a popular option at the moment.
I would've went with something like raw SQLx, but it looks very annoying to use for dynamic queries,
e.g. pages with dynamic filters.
Additionally, since this is a hobby project with a relatively simple data model, and I intend on using
SQLite, I don't think performance is a concern.
